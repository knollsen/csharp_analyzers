# Introduction

This repository contains some C# code analyzers implemented using the Roslyn compiler API. 

A NuGet Package of each analyzer can be found in the root of its directory.

The AuthorizeAnalyzer, ExceptionAnalyzer and NamingAnalyzer are currently supported and verified.

I am working on making the analyzers available in the official NuGet gallery as well.
